# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm re-doing my github profile and have privated most of my old projects.

### Projects:

 - [`vue3-flag-icons`](https://github.com/gavin-lb/vue3-flag-icons): A TypeScript-compatible Vue3 component library for providing flag icons.
   -  Built with Vite
   -  Published to NPM
   -  Full TypeScript support with custom types generated from non-TypeScript compatible dependacy by a node.js script

- `grape-chess`: a (currently private) fullstack chess webapp project. 

  - The front end is written in TypeScript in the Vue3 framework. It: 
    - is a SPA that using Vue Router, 
    - utilises Vuetify library for UI components,
    - uses vue3-chessboard (a Vue3 component library of which [I am a contributor](https://github.com/qwerty084/vue3-chessboard/commits?author=gavin-lb))
     
  - The backend is written in Python using FastAPI. It:
    - implements a RESTful API,
    - uses SocketIO protocol for WebSocket connections with the frontend,
    - uses SQLAlchemy for database handling of user and game data,

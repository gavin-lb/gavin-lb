# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm re-doing my github profile and have privated most of my old projects.

### Current project

I'm currently working on a fullstack chess webapp project. 

 - The front end is written in Typescript in the Vue3 framework. It: 
   - is a SPA that using Vue Router, 
   - utilises Vuetify library for UI components,
   - uses vue3-chessboard (a vue.js component library of which [I am a contributor](https://github.com/qwerty084/vue3-chessboard/commits?author=gavin-lb))
     
- The backend is written in Python using Flask. It:
   - implements a RESTful API,
   - uses SocketIO protocol for WebSocket connections with the frontend,
   - uses SQLAlchemy for database handling of user and game data,

The project is still releatively early in development and so is not yet public.
